Non Graded Challenge
===================
This in non-graded challenge for **Python Syntax, Variables, and Data TypeFTDS Phase 0 - Week 1**.
There are 3 tasks in it.
The first one is counting the unique id in customer list. As we know that set data types can't have duplicate number, so I use this to help me get the unique id only.
The second is indexing a given list.
The last is getting keys from dictionary and changing value in dictionary.
